## Installing the OS
A single setup script is provided for your convenience. It will download the prebuilt release (35.3.1) and apply
the modfied device tree binaries (dtb). Alternatively you can visit the [nvidia official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r35.3.1/DeveloperGuide/text/IN/QuickStart.html#to-flash-the-jetson-developer-kit-operating-software).
```
./setup.sh
```
